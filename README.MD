### Notes
1. Was difficult to navigate around depreceated methods and outdated notes regarding Roundcorners and shared element transitions
2. I had trouble recalling Git terminal methods for pushing a new repo, pulling readme file, and pushing the gif to the repo.
3. Understanding the Movieadapter and it's call mappings was difficult.
4. Unable to setup navigation/scrolling on the landscape view. Would love to hear how to get this done so I can display popularity_score and release_date
